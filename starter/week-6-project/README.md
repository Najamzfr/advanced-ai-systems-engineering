# Week 6 · Adaptation and inference study

This starter runs immediately with a deterministic smoke fixture. The smoke
run verifies the project contract; it is not evidence for the real assignment.

```text
make setup
make run
make test
```

Then fetch the assigned data and run the real check:

```text
python scripts/fetch_data.py --cases 300
make evaluate
make grade
```

The grader requires `data/eval.jsonl`, the declared minimum case count and a
manifest marked `real_data`. It writes `reports/grade.json` so the course page
can display the result without guessing from checkboxes.

Dataset: Versioned labeled subset from Weeks 1–2  
Source: local:course-split-manifest.json  
Minimum real cases: 300  
Required artifact: `reports/adaptation_report.json`

Required measurements: task quality, data leakage checks, TTFT, tokens/sec, p95 latency, peak memory

The starter exposes `make check-step-1` through `make check-step-12`. Each
target reads `reports/metrics.json` and reports observed versus required
values. `make grade` writes structured `reports/grade.json` evidence for the
course importer.

The included provider/runtime is intentionally small and deterministic. Extend
it with the week’s actual system, preserve raw evidence, and document failures
before claiming success.
